## 0.1.1

Added a new set, `package:oath/flutter/*.yaml`, for Flutter packages.

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml

# Strict set of lints and analysis options.
include: package:oath/flutter/library.yaml

# Relaxed set of lints and analysis options.
include: package:oath/flutter/application.yaml
```

## 0.1.0

Initial release, with two sets of lints:

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml

# Strict set of lints and analysis options.
include: package:oath/library.yaml
```

Or, for a slightly relaxed set for applications:

```yaml
# Relaxed set of lints and analysis options.
include: package:oath/application.yaml
```
