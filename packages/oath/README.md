Lints serve as your guide, ensuring your code adheres to the highest standards
of valor:

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml

include: package:oath/strict.yaml
```

Or, for Flutter packages:

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml

include: package:oath/flutter/strict.yaml
```

As an alternative, use a _relaxed_ set of lints:

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml

include: package:oath/relaxed.yaml
```

Or, for Flutter:

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml

include: package:oath/flutter/relaxed.yaml
```
