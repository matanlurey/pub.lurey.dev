# Change Log

## 0.1.1

- Added `Uint8Grid`, the first sub-type of `TypedDataGrid`. A `Uint8Grid`, like
  it's counterpart `Uint8List`, is a grid of _unsigned 8-bit integers_, which
  makes it suitable for storing pixel data, tile maps, and other data that can
  be represented as a grid of 8-bit values.

## 0.1.0

🎉 Initial release 🎉
