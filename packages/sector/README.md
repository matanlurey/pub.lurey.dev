## Getting Started

Add a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` or run the following command:

```bash
dart pub add sector
```

### Usage

`Grid` is the 2-dimensional equivalent of a `List` in Dart:

```dart
// Create a 2D grid with 80 columns and 24 rows filled with spaces.
final grid = Grid.filled(80, 24, ' ');
```

```dart
// Create a 2D grid from an existing 2D matrix-like collection.
final grid = Grid.fromRows([
  [' ', '#', '#', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', '#', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
]);
```

Check the bounds, `get`, and `set` elements:

```dart
// Check if a point is within the bounds of the grid.
if (grid.containsXY(0, 0)) {
  // ...
}

// Get the element at a point.
final element = grid.get(0, 0);

// Set the element at a point.
grid.set(0, 0, '#');
```

Iterate over the grid with `rows` and `columns`:

```dart
// Iterate over the rows of the grid.
for (final row in grid.rows) {
  // ...
}
```

```dart
// Expand or shrink the grid on demand.
grid.rows.insertFirst(['#', '#', '#', '#']);
```

## Features

- Platform _independent_, works on the Web, Flutter, and Dart VM.
- *Idiomatic*ally Dart, with a familiar and fully documented API.
- _Extensible_, with a focus on performance and ergonomics.
- _Well-tested_, with 100% code coverage and property-based tests.
- _Lightweight_, with zero dependencies, minimal overhead, and benchmarked.

### Benchmarks

For a data structure like a `Grid`, it will almost always be faster to
hand-write an optimal repsentation for your specific use case. However,
`sector` is designed to be a general-purpose 2D grid that is fast enough
for most applications.

[Compared to a baseline implementation](./benchmark/README.md), `Grid` is
roughly the _same speed_ as a hand-optimized implementation, in JIT and AOT
modes (within <1% difference).
