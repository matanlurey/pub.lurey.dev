/// Pathfinding algorithm that search the shallowest nodes in a graph first.
///
/// Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree
/// or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node
/// of a graph), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth
/// prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
///
/// Breadth-first search's main use case compared to other unweighted algorithms
/// is that it never gets "trapped" exploring a suboptimal path, as it will
/// always find the shortest path first. However, it has a higher memory
/// overhead than other algorithms (`O(b^d)` where `b` is the branching factor
/// and `d` is the depth of the solution) compared to [DepthFirstSearch].
///
/// A default singleton instance of this class is [breadthFirstSearch].
///
