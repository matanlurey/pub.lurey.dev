/// Pathfinding algorithm that explores the graph in depth first order.
///
/// Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or
/// graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as
/// far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
///
/// Depth-first search is often compared to breadth-first search (BFS). The
/// biggest difference between the two is that depth-first search can get
/// "trapped" exploring a suboptimal path, as it will always find the deepest
/// path first. However, it has a lower memory overhead than other algorithms
/// (`O(bd)` where `b` is the branching factor and `d` is the depth of the
/// solution) compared to [BreadthFirstSearch].
///
/// A default singleton instance of this class is [depthFirstSearch].
