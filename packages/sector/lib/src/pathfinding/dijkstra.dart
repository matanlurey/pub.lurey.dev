/// Pathfinding algorithm that finds the best path in a weighted graph.
///
/// Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between
/// nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks, networks
/// of pipes, or tiles on a grid. It starts at a source node and explores
/// branches of the graph along all possible paths as far as necessary,
/// backtracking when it fails to find the goal, _or_ the cost of the path
/// exceeds a previously found path with a lower cost.
///
/// Dijkstra's algorithm is a generalization of the [breadthFirstSearch]
/// algorithm. It is guaranteed to find the shortest path from the source node,
/// but it has a potentially high runtime complexity (`O((V + E) log V)` where
/// `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges), as in the
/// worst case it may visit every edge in the graph.
///
/// A default singleton instance of this class is [dijkstra].
