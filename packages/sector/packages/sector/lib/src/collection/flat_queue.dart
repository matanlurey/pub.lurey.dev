/// A very fast and tiny binary heap priority queue that stores `(int, double`).
///
/// Similar to [`HeapPriorityQueue<(int, double)`][HeapPriorityQueue] but stores
/// the queue as two flat lists, one for the items (32-bit integers) and their
/// priority values (32-bit floats) respectively, and does not perform list
/// compaction after removing elements unless [compact] is called manually.
///
/// [HeapPriorityQueue]: https://pub.dev/documentation/collection/latest/collection/HeapPriorityQueue-class.html
///
/// ## Memory Allocation
///
/// In order to avoid thrashing spending main-thread time on performing list
/// compaction, the queue does not compact itself after removing elements,
/// retaining the (relatively cheap) `int` and `double` slots for future use.
/// This means that on long-running algorithms, the queue may grow in size
/// indefinitely, potentially causing memory issues, and should be discarded
/// (to let the native memory be garbage collected) when no longer needed.
///
/// ```dart
/// // Add 100 elements to a queue.
/// final queue = FlatQueue();
/// for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
///   queue.add(i, i.toDouble());
/// }
///
/// // Clear the queue, but the memory is still allocated.
/// queue.clear();
/// print(queue.length); // 0
/// print(queue.capacity); // 100
/// ```
///
/// To manually free up memory without discarding, you can call [compact]:
///
/// ```dart
/// final queue = FlatQueue();
/// for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
///   queue.add(i, i.toDouble());
/// }
///
/// queue.clear();
/// queue.compact();
/// print(queue.capacity); // 0
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// The performance of the queue is predictable for a binary heap:
///
/// - `length`: `O(1)`
/// - `peek`: `O(1)`
/// - `pop`: `O(log n)`
/// - `add`: `O(log n)`
///
/// When compared to [`HeapPriorityQueue<(int, double)`][HeapPriorityQueue],
/// it's approximately:
///
/// - **~2x faster** to add elements;
/// - **~8x faster** when removing elements.
///
/// That is a significant speed up if you can deal with the constraints of this
/// queue.
///
/// {@category Collections}
final class FlatQueue {
  /// Creates an empty minimum priority queue.
  ///
  /// May optionally specify an [initialCapacity] and [growthRate]. Setting
  /// an [initialCapacity] can reduce the number of memory allocations needed
  /// when adding elements to the queue, and [growthRate] can be used to
  /// control how much the queue grows when it runs out of capacity, which
  /// additionally can reduce the number of memory allocations needed. For
  /// tuning algorithms, it's recommended to set [initialCapacity] to the
  /// expected number of elements in the queue, and [growthRate] to a value
  /// greater than 1.0 (which is the default).
  ///
  /// ## Example

  /// ```dart
  /// final queue = FlatQueue(initialCapacity: 100, growthRate: 1.5);
  /// ```
